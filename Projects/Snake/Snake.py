import pygame #Imports the Pygame package, which is crucial for pretty much everything here.
pygame.init() #Initializes the Pygame module, which then allows everything that comes after to function.
dis=pygame.display.set_mode((400,300)) #Creates the screen that users will use to view the game.
pygame.display.update() #This method updates any changes made to said screen.
pygame.quit() #Quits the game. Pretty self-explanatory.
quit() #Quits the Python script. Even MORE self-explanatory.
